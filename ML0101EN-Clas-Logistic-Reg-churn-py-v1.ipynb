    "\n",
    "While Linear Regression is suited for estimating continuous values (e.g. estimating house price), it is not the best tool for predicting the class of an observed data point. In order to estimate the class of a data point, we need some sort of guidance on what would be the **most probable class** for that data point. For this, we use **Logistic Regression**.\n",

    "As you know, __Linear regression__ finds a function that relates a continuous dependent variable, _y_, to some predictors (independent variables _x1_, _x2_, etc.). For example, Simple linear regression assumes a function of the form:\n",
    "<br><br>\n",
    "$$\n",
    "y = 𝜃0 + 𝜃1 * x1 + 𝜃2 * x2 +...\n",
    "$$\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "and finds the values of parameters _θ0_, _θ1_, _𝜃2_, etc, where the term _𝜃0_ is the \"intercept\". It can be generally shown as:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "<p></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic Regression is a variation of Linear Regression, useful when the observed dependent variable, _y_, is categorical. It produces a formula that predicts the probability of the class label as a function of the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression fits a special s-shaped curve by taking the linear regression and transforming the numeric estimate into a probability with the following function, which is called sigmoid function 𝜎:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Or:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "ProbabilityOfaClass_1 =  P(Y=1|X) = 𝜎({θ^TX}) = \\frac{e^{θ^TX}}{1+e^{θ^TX}} \n",

It is a common \"S\" shape (sigmoid curve).\n",
